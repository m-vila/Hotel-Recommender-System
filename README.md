# A hotel recommender system

This is a project for the full-time Data Science course at [AllWomen](https://www.allwomen.tech) where I created a hotel recommender system.

My main goals were:
1) To better understand how travel platforms like Booking.com generate their recommendations
2) To find the best hotels to plan my next trip

I found [a great dataset in kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe) from 2017 containing 515K customer reviews of almost 15K luxury hotels from Booking.com.

In this repository there are the following files:

1. Recommender System 2017 data - notebook where I build the hotel recommender system
2. The datasets used for that purpose
